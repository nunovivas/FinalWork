\section{Consistency and Replication}

This section analyzes why replication is used and how consistency guarantees are defined and implemented.

\subsection{Replication Strategies}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Compare active/passive replication, leader-based replication, and multi-leader models.

\subsection{Consistency Models}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Present strong, eventual, and causal consistency with practical examples.

\subsection{CAP and Design Trade-offs}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Discuss availability-partition tolerance trade-offs and implications for system design choices.
