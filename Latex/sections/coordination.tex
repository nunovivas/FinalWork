\section{Coordination}

This section studies how distributed processes cooperate to achieve correct global behavior.

\subsection{Time, Ordering, and Logical Clocks}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Introduce physical clocks, Lamport clocks, and vector clocks for reasoning about event order.

\subsection{Mutual Exclusion and Leader Election}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Present algorithms and trade-offs for controlling shared resources and selecting coordinators.

\subsection{Consensus and Agreement}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Explain the role of consensus protocols (e.g., Paxos/Raft) and their practical constraints.
