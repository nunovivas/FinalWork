\section{Fault Tolerance}

This section examines how distributed systems detect, isolate, and recover from failures.

\subsection{Failure Models}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Define crash, omission, timing, and Byzantine failures in distributed contexts.

\subsection{Detection and Recovery Mechanisms}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Explain heartbeats, checkpointing, rollback recovery, and failover procedures.

\subsection{Redundancy and Availability Engineering}
\textbf{Draft notes:} Discuss replication, redundancy planning, and service-level objectives.
