** Scalability of publish-subscribe systems
As with so many hypes, lots of folks have started to ride the wave of publish-subscribe
systems without really understanding what is going on. Fortunately, your expert team does
understand what is in that wave. You have been hired by a company (called REPS) that wants
to set up a nationwide competitor to funda.nl for selling and renting a range of real estate.
Their unique selling point is that a customer can subscribe to new property that matches
their wishes such that within only a few seconds they will receive a notification when that
property comes available.
You immediately understand that you're dealing with a content-based publish-subscribe
system, but with the current turnover in the housing market, you also understand that
scaling may be an issue. Moreover, missing out on a notification may lead to claims by
customers.
To this end, you decide to dig further into the matter and identify the tradeoffs REPS needs
to consider. You ask yourself whether a simpler topic-based or channel-based pub-sub
system can suffice, or perhaps a combination of the two. In any case, you will need to make
clear to REPS what they are facing up to. To make matters worse, REPS has decided that it
would prefer to also guarantee that matches remain anonymous, allowing them to make use
of existing cloud-based services without the need to fully trust those services. If time allows,
you will also advise on this additional requirement, knowing that it is not going to help
keeping matters simple.
